        "company": "During my Bachelor's in Computer Science at NIT Puducherry, I gained a strong foundation in programming and development. The curriculum and projects provided a comprehensive understanding of various programming languages and development tools. I began by learning programming fundamentals with C, which gave me a solid grasp of basic algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. This experience was crucial in building a foundation for more advanced topics later in my studies. As I progressed, I was introduced to web development, where I learned JavaScript for dynamic front-end functionalities and PHP for server-side scripting. This combination of languages helped me understand how web applications work from both the client and server perspectives. Additionally, I was introduced to Python by one of my seniors, which opened up new possibilities for me in the field of data science and automation. Python's simplicity and versatility made it easy to pick up and quickly apply to real-world problems. One of the highlights of my time at NIT Puducherry was the opportunity to develop and improve our existing college website. This project involved both front-end and back-end development, requiring me to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. It was a significant learning experience that helped me understand web development's practical aspects, such as user experience, website performance, and security. Overall, my Bachelor's education provided me with a diverse skill set, combining programming fundamentals with practical web development experience.",
