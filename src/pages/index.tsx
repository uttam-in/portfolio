        During my time at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) from June 2019 to December 2021, working with the Walgreens client in Bengaluru, India, I had the opportunity to work as a Systems Engineer and contribute to several impactful projects. This period was marked by continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration with talented teams to deliver meaningful technological solutions.

One of my key responsibilities was to design front-end applications and analytics pages using **Angular**. I focused on building a solid UI architecture that prioritized performance, application security, and resilience. Ensuring that our applications were not just functional but also extensible and secure was always a top priority. I developed multiple UI screens for Analytics dashboards, which allowed our team and stakeholders to visualize data more effectively, identify trends, and make informed decisions. It was exciting to see how these dashboards facilitated data-driven decision-making across various levels of the organization.

I also worked on optimizing project efficiency and task management by orchestrating background job scheduling. I integrated the **Celery scheduler** with **Redis** and **RabbitMQ**, which significantly streamlined our workflow processes. This integration was crucial for handling background tasks and ensuring that our applications performed smoothly under various loads.

Another significant achievement was improving business processes within the retail supply chain. I implemented a **Business Rule Engine** within a runtime production environment, which was a game-changer for the Walgreens client. This engine enabled dynamic decision-making in real-time, which was critical for managing the complexities of the retail supply chain. Alongside this, I designed integrated dashboards specifically for **Retail Business analytics**. These dashboards provided key insights into business operations, enabling our client to optimize their processes and enhance their decision-making capabilities.

Effective communication was another essential aspect of my role. I ensured a seamless translation of business requirements into technological solutions by actively communicating with team members, stakeholders, and management. This alignment between technology initiatives and company objectives was vital for achieving our project goals and delivering high-quality results.

Additionally, I took on the challenge of designing and implementing a model to optimize space utilization, which significantly improved inventory management and operational efficiency for the Walgreens client. This project required a deep understanding of the client's business needs and the ability to translate those needs into a technological solution that delivered tangible benefits.

Overall, my experience at TCS was incredibly fulfilling. I had the chance to work on diverse projects that allowed me to hone my technical skills in front-end development, system integration, and process optimization, all while contributing to the success of a major client in the retail sector. It was a period of growth, both professionally and personally, and I am proud of the work I accomplished during this time.

        Let me share a bit about my journey in building and implementing technical solutions that have made a real difference in various systems and workflows.

It all started when I took on the challenge of enhancing how we monitored our mainframe jobs. I knew that the current method was too cumbersome and lacked real-time visibility. So, I developed a prototype for **Mainframe Spool Monitoring** using Python scripting. It was my first significant project involving Python, and I was excited to see how it could transform our approach. The prototype allowed us to track and analyze mainframe job statuses in real-time, which immediately started paying off. It was rewarding to see how the new system helped our team identify issues proactively and improve the overall reliability of our operations.

Around the same time, I became fascinated with AI and its potential to streamline everyday processes. I decided to dive deeper into this area and came up with the idea of designing a **Quality Assurance (QA) System** using IBM Watson APIs. It was a bit of a leap, moving from traditional methods to something as advanced as AI. But I was driven by the potential for innovation. The new system could analyze data with AI-powered insights, drastically reducing the time spent on manual checks and improving accuracy. Watching our QA processes become more efficient, I felt a sense of accomplishment—knowing that I had contributed to a smarter way of working.

The next challenge came in the form of long-running jobs on our mainframe. It was clear that we needed a better way to manage and monitor these jobs without relying on manual checks. That’s when I developed the **Mainframe Spool Crawling Module** in Python. This module automated the entire workflow process, which used to be painstakingly manual. With this solution, we could quickly and accurately monitor long-running jobs, freeing up our team to focus on more critical tasks. I realized how powerful automation could be in making our day-to-day operations smoother and more efficient.

Then came an opportunity to work with Salesforce data. I saw a gap in how we communicated between different platforms and decided to tackle it head-on. By integrating the **Salesforce API with our existing systems**, I made it possible for us to manipulate and handle Salesforce data much more seamlessly. This integration didn’t just enhance data accuracy; it also enabled real-time communication between platforms, which was a huge win for our team. I learned a lot about API integrations and felt proud to have made data exchange smoother and more efficient.

Finally, I focused on a smaller but equally impactful task: creating a module that could **auto-update job completion records**. I noticed that manually documenting job completions was not only tedious but also prone to errors and delays. I decided to automate it. This module ensured that job completions were recorded promptly and accurately, eliminating manual efforts and errors. Seeing how this small innovation made a big difference in our daily workflow was incredibly satisfying.

Looking back, each project taught me something new about the power of technology—how it can automate the mundane, bring intelligence to the routine, and connect disparate systems into a cohesive whole. I’ve enjoyed every step of the journey, from scripting in Python to integrating APIs and leveraging AI. It’s been a fulfilling experience, knowing that I’ve made processes simpler, faster, and more efficient for the teams I’ve worked with.
